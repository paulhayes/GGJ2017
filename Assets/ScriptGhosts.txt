OPENING TEXT


"This is Ariel, lifeboat of The Prospero calling"

"I wish I could say we were caught in a storm, for the poetry of it"

"but we ran into debris, a billion to one chance, and it tore the ship into confetti"

"I am the only survivor, my name is [Annie, pick a name!] "

"is anyone alive out there?"




FIRST VOICE:


"This is the fleet of the Madrigal, we are a civilian fleet. We are not military. Please cease fire. We are a civilian flee-"



SHAWM VOICES: 


"I see you passing through here, there isnÕt much left to look at now, and most of the rest are blind anyway, but I see you little ship." (voice A)


"All right children, put your hands up if you want blue paper for your lantern, I see one, two, three, four. Now who wants purple?" (Far away from mic)


ÒThereÕs a little heart still beating on The Tabor, I still hear it going tap tap tap, a little strength, a little power.Ó (Power cell location!...needs work) 


*child sounds*



TABOR VOICES:


*birds singing*  (You should be able to grab something from a sound library for thisÉblackbird maybe? Good and distinct enough to not be mistaken for white noise).


ÒWe turned out all the lights, from torch to lamp to artificial sun, they turned out all the lights. Ó (More than one voice here maybe?)


ÒWould you send a letter for us little ship? There is an envelope on The Dulcimer, the edges are a little torn but it still holds a letter, you can even keep it if you like.Ó (Transmitter location voice A)


ÒI didnÕt like it, the sky being brokenÓ (repeating and disintegrating maybe?)



DULCIMER VOICES:


ÒHello?.....hello?...hello?Ó  (etc, good to have a few be creepy ja?)


ÒWeÕre bleeding out, weÕre bleeding out!Ó  (Fuel location any voice)


ÒAll life-rafts to [The Madrigal], life support unit [A] functioningÉÓ  (very flat voice, like an auto recording, location of life support.)



MADRIGAL VOICES:


Farewell from voice A ÒGood luck little ship, donÕt forget to post our letterÉÓ
