OPENING TEXT


"This is Ariel, lifeboat of The Prospero calling"

"I wish I could say we were caught in a storm, for the poetry of it"

"but we ran into debris, a billion to one chance, and it tore the ship into confetti"

"I am the only survivor, my name is [Annie, pick a name!] "

"is anyone alive out there?"




FIRST VOICE:


[0] "This is the fleet of the Madrigal, we are a civilian fleet. We are not military. Please cease fire. We are a civilian flee-"



SHAWM VOICES: 


[1]  "I see you passing through here, there isn't much left to look at now, and most of the rest are blind anyway, but I see you little ship." (voice A)


[2]  "All right children, put your hands up if you want blue paper for your lantern, I see one, two, three, four. Now who wants purple?" (Far away from mic)


=[3]= "There's a little heart still beating on The Tabor, I still hear it going tap tap tap, a little strength, a little power." (Power cell location!...needs work) 


[4] *child sounds*


TABOR VOICES:


[5] *birds singing*  (You should be able to grab something from a sound library for thisÉblackbird maybe? Good and distinct enough to not be mistaken for white noise).


[6] "We turned out all the lights, from torch to lamp to artificial sun, they turned out all the lights. " (More than one voice here maybe?)


=[6]= Would you send a letter for us little ship? There is an envelope on The Dulcimer, the edges are a little torn but it still holds a letter, you can even keep it if you like.Ó (Transmitter location voice A)


[7] "I didn't like it, the sky being brokenÓ (repeating and disintegrating maybe?)"



DULCIMER VOICES:


[8] "Hello?.....hello?...hello?Ó  (etc, good to have a few be creepy ja?)


[9] "We're bleeding out, weÕre bleeding out!Ó  (Fuel location any voice)"


=[10]= "All life-rafts to [The Madrigal], life support unit [A] functioning"  (very flat voice, like an auto recording, location of life support.)



MADRIGAL VOICES:


[11] "Farewell from voice A ÒGood luck little ship, donÕt forget to post our letter"
